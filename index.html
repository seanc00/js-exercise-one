            Task: Write a program that begins by prompting the user 
            to type in a positive integer (lets call it ). If the 
            number typed () is not positive (i.e. bigger than zero) 
            than it should ask again. After this the program should 
            repeatedly ask the user to type in an integer, until 
            numbers have been typed in. After this the program 
            should print the sum of these numbers.
